                My name is Peter Schnizer and I am a Junior Data Science major at William & Mary. During my time here, I have acquired a broad 
                range of interests within the fields of mathematics, computer science, and biology. Originally I was a CAMS Mathematical Biology major so I first developed interests in
                biological applications of mathematical/stochastic modeling as well as statistics. This eventually led to a smooth transition into Data Science where I have applied my knowledge
                in machine learning to my passion for sports. Possibly my favorite aspect of Data Science is programming which is why I chose to find a job in software engineering which I will be starting 
                this summer.
